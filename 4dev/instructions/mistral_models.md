## Model deprecation

### Overview
Our model offering is continuously refreshed with newer, better models. As part of this process, we deprecate and retire older models. This document provides information about which models are currently available, deprecated, or retired.

### Terminology
- **Deprecation date:** The date to mark the model as deprecated. When a model is deprecated, it continues to be available for use by customers with existing deployments until the model is retired.
- **Retirement date:** The date to mark the model as retired. When a model is retired from la Plateforme, it is no longer available for use, and when prompted, it will return an error response.

### How to Prepare for Model Retirements and Version Upgrades
To prepare for model retirements and version upgrades, we recommend that customers evaluate their applications with the new models and versions and assess their behavior. We also recommend that customers update their applications to use the new models and versions before the retirement date
